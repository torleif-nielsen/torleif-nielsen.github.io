### The who part about me


Hi! My name is Tor and I am a mostly self-trained **Code Monkey** based in Honolulu, who develops for the web.

For as long as I can remember I have loved to build things, and every finished project just spawned new ideas to pursue. If I have to attribute any one thing to my getting involved with programming, I would say it was Legos. As a kid I had the luxury of more Legos than I knew what to do with, and after Legos I had "Zometools", which let me build even stranger and more complex things.

Fast forward to 16 years old I stumbled upon [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)'s Ruby tutorials and I just started playing with it. I very quickly realized I had stumbled upon a means of building something that could be massive in scale without littering the floor with plastic caltrops.

I set about scouring the internet for all kinds of resources from forum posts and blogs to video tutorials. After a couple of years playing with Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and C, I decided I wanted to build for the platforms I used the most-- the web browsers.

I started to reinforce my HTML knowledge and pick up web frameworks like Rails, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, and later Meteor. I realized around then that I had incurred a massive debt to open source communities. I resolved at that point to pursue a degree in a Computer related field and further develop my skills so that I can give back to open source.

Long story short I am addicted to learning and building new things, and sharing everything I learn with others.


### What I am usually up to


I am currently a Undergraduate student in the UH Computer Science program with the fortune to be employed as a Web Programmer for the Distance Course Design & Consulting group at UH Manoa (which means I am a *professional* **Code Monkey**). When school is in session I am easily found amongst the computer related clubs on campus.

When I can find the time I teach a variety of topics about programming and software engineering to fellow students. I have taught high school and college students how to use git, fundamental programming concepts, program design, test-driven and behavior-driven development, and some topics relating to specific programming languages (e.g. Functional vs OO programming).
