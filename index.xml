      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my newly redesigned and relaunched website. I rebuilt the site to explore some new ideas I picked up after a year of working as a professional web developer. More notably I threw out a number of superfluous pieces in favor of some simpler layouts that play nicer with accessibility and responsive concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ORCA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ORCA (Online Resource &amp;amp; Content Administrator)&lt;/em&gt; platform is a project I would like to develop in response to the LMS frameworks and platforms in use such as Sakai, Moodle, Blackboard, and others. Having used Blackboard and Sakai as a student I found myself very stressed with the platform and wished many of the features would be more friendly and be more performant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also to accomplish building a system that could be distributed easily over a long distance and many hot-pluggable nodes but still function as a single application with a means of populating rich content to better support a learning environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still very much in the planning stage but I am looking at using Elixir, Elm, and Phoenix to begin work on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kaiapuni&amp;rdquo; is an i18n enabled online platform for creating, distributing, and scoring standardized exams for culturally diverse testing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the system I was tasked with working on during my year with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dcdc.coe.hawaii.edu/&#34;&gt;Distance Course Design &amp;amp; Consulting Group&lt;/a&gt;. There were two primary developers on the project, with a few guest stars for some of the finer details. We built it from the ground up and reached feature-complete within the first 7 months, and used the remaining time on the wish-list features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for such a system arose from an issue with the &lt;em&gt;No Child Left Behind Act&lt;/em&gt; and Hawaiian Immersion Schools where students are not given a formal introduction to English in the first few grade levels. In order to support these schools an alternative needed to be produced to facilitate the entire testing process from creation, to distribution, to scoring, in the native language of these communities. That said, the system was designed to support any language, provided the end user includes the desired translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-forward&#34;&gt;Going Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no longer working for the DCDC group but there was a lot of value in the project both for the clients and for myself as one of the first few major projects I contributed to. There were many very specific features that needed to be included to satisfy State and Federal standards which proved to be challenging and valuable experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have their blessing to create a concept fork of the system and I am considering rebuilding it in either a Rails 5 with React setup, or Phoenix and Elm. Either way I am interested in a better view layer as there were features that were particularly arduous with just the vanilla Rails 4 stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Tor and I am a mostly self-trained Software Developer hailing from Honolulu, and I develop primarily for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember I have loved to build things, and every finished project just spawned new ideas to pursue. If I have to attribute any one thing to my start in programming, I would say it was Legos. As a kid I had the luxury of more Legos than I knew what to do with, and after Legos I had &amp;ldquo;Zometools&amp;rdquo;, which let me build even stranger and more complex things. Not long after that I received one of the first Lego Mindstorms kits and began learning how to program the yellow brick to power my strange creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 16 years old I found a book on Lisp and stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.codecademy.com/&#34;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Ruby tutorials and I just started playing with languages. I very quickly realized I had stumbled upon a means of building something that could be massive in scale without littering the floor with plastic caltrops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set about scouring the internet for all kinds of resources from forum posts and blogs to video tutorials. Following that I found interest in conference talk recordings and diving into GitHub repositories. After a couple of years playing with Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and C, I decided I wanted to build for the platforms I used the most&amp;ndash; the web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to reinforce my HTML knowledge and pick up web frameworks like Rails, Drupal, WordPress, and later Meteor. I realized around then that I had incurred a massive debt to open source communities. I resolved at that point to pursue a degree in a Computer related field and further develop my skills so that I can give back to open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short I am addicted to learning and building new things, and sharing everything I learn with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-am-usually-up-to&#34;&gt;What I am usually up to&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently graduated from UH Computer Science program with a B.S. in Computer Science, and left my position as a Web Programmer for the Distance Course Design &amp;amp; Consulting group at UH Manoa. When school was in session I was easily found amongst the computer related clubs on campus and now I hang out in chat channels all over the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I could find the time, I taught a variety of topics about programming and software engineering to fellow students. I have taught high school and college students how to develop with git, fundamental programming concepts, program design, test-driven and behavior-driven development, and some topics relating to specific programming languages (e.g. Functional vs OO programming).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently since graduating I have taken to contributing more to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/torleif-nielsen&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and writing for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gitbook.com/@torleif-nielsen/&#34;&gt;GitBook&lt;/a&gt; platform.&lt;/p&gt;
