Barn Owl is a placeholder name for a project I am working on to build an open source platform for creating and proctoring exams to students in the language of a school's choosing.

The project is a concept clone of a platform I contributed to for work, it was built on Rails and designed to support Hawaiian language speaking students. I want to create a variant of the platform built on a Phoenix stack instead. I think that the system will be more performant and its features easier to extend if built as an umbrella Phoenix application.
