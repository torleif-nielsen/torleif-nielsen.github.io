Orca is an ambitious project I will be working on as a sort of "Senior project" in my last semester as an undergraduate. It will be a modular LMS to compete with systems like Sakai, Blackboard, Canvas, and others.

I will be using Phoenix for the back end of the platform as I want to make something extremely efficient that can support anywhere from a dozen to thousands of users simultaneously without performance degradation.
