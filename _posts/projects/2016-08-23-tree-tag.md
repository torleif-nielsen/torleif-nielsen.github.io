Tree Tag is a web application coupled with a mobile app designed to support
biologists in collecting data in the field. The name comes from tagging trees
by biologists.

The general idea is that an individual in the field can take readings and
measurements in a variety of formats, whether it be text, numeric, photo, or
geo-tags. This data will be pushed up to a server from the mobile device and
then pushed to all other clients in a particular research team.

An example use case would be if a researcher was in a lab while several people
were in the field, the field researchers can collect data separately and
all of it can be aggregated and analyzed on the full screen web view back at
the lab.
