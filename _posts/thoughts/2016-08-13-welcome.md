Welcome to my website!

This site is built using Jekyll, and GitHub is hosting it through GitHub Pages. The styling framework I am using is Foundation 6 (a big thanks to [Daigo Fuji](https://github.com/daigofuji) for his Jekyll + Foundation example).

I plan to post my thoughts and project ideas on this website as a means of keeping track of my programming work, which has grown to become a large part of my life and what I love to do.

I hope to also contribute examples out of some of my projects if I manage to solve a problem others may encounter. You will see me use them as GitHub gists, as that gives me more flexibility if I want to use that snippet in another documentation format.

Here is a trivial example of how it will appear:

{% gist torleif-nielsen/6a68b8209b473bfb6a12861f5683d1c6 %}


You can find information about the projects I am working on and the skills I am developing using the options on the navigation bar at the top of this page.
